## Contents
- A "hello world" Go application / service.
- Configuration environment variables.
- Secret environment variables.
- Volume mounts to read/write files.
- Creating the app container image.
- Deployment to Kubernetes with Skaffold.
- Customisation to Staging, Production etc.
 environments with Kustomize.

## Hello World
cmd/hello/main.go:

.code cmd/hello/main.go  /^func main/,/^}/

Let's look at `displayFileContents`.

## displayFileContents

.code cmd/hello/main.go  /^func displayFileContents/,/^}/

Let's run our hello world service with its default configuration and secrets:
```
go run cmd/hello/main.go
```

## Configuration and Secrets

 .gitignore:

.code .gitignore

local.env:

.code local.env

local.secret.env:

.code local.secret.env

## Running hello service locally

Let's export the configuration and secrets files
into the environment.

Then run our service.
```
 . local.env
 . local.secret.env

go run cmd/hello/main.go
```

## Take a break: Check that you understand how to configure and run a service locally.

## Containerising our service

## Dockerfile
Dockerfile:

.code Dockerfile

## Building the docker image

Below, I am tagging my image "junk" because this is
a throw-away development image only used for
demo purposes.

Note the `.` in the command. This tells docker to look
for a Dockerfile in the current directory.

```
docker build -t junk .
```

## Running the docker image

```
docker run --rm -it -P junk
``` 

The:
1. --rm is to remove the container after the run ends.
1. -it: -i is to create an interactive session and -t to allocate a terminal.
1. -P is to allocate a port(s) on your local machine to connect to the docker instance's
 exposed port(s) running "inside" the docker environment.

## Testing the docker container instance

1. Determine which port was allocated on my local machine
 when a container was created from the "junk" image.
   ```
   docker ps | grep junk
   ```

1. Test the service. 192.168.1.68 is the IP of my local development machine.
   ```
   curl 192.168.1.68:{port}/
   ```

## Take a break: Check that you understand how to containerise an application.

## Kubernetes essentials

## Install kubernetes
Options:
1. Docker Desktop: See https://www.docker.com/products/kubernetes

1. kind (kubernetes in docker): See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#kind

1. Minikube: See https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/#minikube

1. microk8s: See https://microk8s.io/

## Install kubectl
kubectl controls your kubernetes cluster. Install it if your
kubernetes distribution does not already provide it.

Get it from: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/

Check the connection to your kubernetes cluster:
```
$ kubectl cluster-info
Kubernetes master is running at https://192.168.1.68:16443
CoreDNS is running at https://192.168.1.68:16443/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kube-dns:dns/proxy

$ kubectl get nodes
NAME   STATUS   ROLES    AGE    VERSION
ln02   Ready    <none>   223d   v1.20.0-37+7ab055a22f5440

## Create a kubernetes service
A kubernetes service acts like a load-balancer to connect the outside
world to "pods" running inside kubernetes.

See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
for details.

## kube/hello-service.yaml:

.code kube/hello-service.yaml

Note the label key/value pair:
```
app: hello
```

We will use this label to "find" this service later.

## Ask kubernetes to create or update the service

`kubectl apply -f` will:
1. read the yaml file(s) and  

1. send it to the kubernetes controller

The kubernetes controller will then:
1. read the `declarations` in the file and
1. make the kubernetes environment match what was
 declared.
```
kubectl apply -f kube/hello-service.yaml
kubectl get services -l app=hello
```

Because of kubernetes declarative nature, `kubectl apply` is idempotent.
Try running it a second or third time.

## kubernetes service type: NodePort
When we run:
```
kubectl get services -l app=hello
```
we see the type to be NodePort.

There a several types of kubernetes services.

See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types).

A NodePort service type means kubernetes will allocate a port on my local machine
(and on all nodes in the kubernetes cluster).

This port is connected to the service running inside kubernetes.

## kubernetes pods
A kubernetes pod is roughly equivalent to a docker container.

See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/)
for details.

Running an unmanaged pod directly on kubernetes is *not* recommended.
If a pod fails, kubernetes will not restart it.

## For educational purpose only: Create a kubernetes pod
For educational purposes *only*, I will create the hello service to
run as a pod in kubernetes.

kube/hello-pod.yaml:

.code kube/hello-pod.yaml

## pod: labels, image and resources

**labels**:
```
app: hello
```
The hello service uses this label to find the pod and connect to it.
The service is the "load-balancer" and the pod is the "backend".

**image**: tells kubernetes which image to use.
I first had to push the image to docker hub (or the image registry of your choice).
```
docker tag junk siuyin/junk
docker push siuyin/junk
```

**resources**: tells kubernetes the memory and CPU requirements
for running the pod.

## Testing the hello service on kubernetes

1. Ask kubernetes to create the pod
   ```
   kubectl apply -f kube/hello-pod.yaml
   kubectl get pods -l app=hello
   ```

1. Find the node port
   ```
   kubectl get svc -l app=hello
   ```

1. Test the hello-service
   ```
   curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
   ```

1. Delete the pod and retest.
   ```
   kubectl delete po --force
   curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
   ```

Kubernetes does *not* re-create a failed or terminated pod.

The kubernetes hello service will not have a backend pod
to connect to when the pod fails.

## Take a break: Check that you understand how kubernetes services and pods work.

## kubernetes deployments
When we deploy a pod directly into kubernetes, kubernetes does not re-create
or restart the pod if it fails.

A kubernetes deployment *will* re-create pods that fail.  
See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/)
for details.

This is the recommended way to deploy pods into kubernetes.

## kube/hello-deployment.yaml

.code kube/hello-deployment-basic.yaml

## deployment / label, spec selector and spec template
Let's ask kubernetes to run implement this deployment:
```
kubectl apply -f kube/hello-deployment-basic.yaml
kubectl get po -l app=hello
```
```
kubectl scale deploy hello --replicas=5
```

- The deployment label is to allow kubectl to find the deployment
   ```
   kubectl get deploy -l app=hello
   ```

- The deployment spec / selector works the same way as a service selector.

- A deployment selector looks for pods with matching labels
for the deployment to manage.

- Note that we do not need kube/hello-pod.yaml anymore.

- Instead we place the pod `template` into the deployment yaml itself.

## Configuration maps for deployments
See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-pod-configmap/)
for details.

kube/hello-configmap.yaml:

.code kube/hello-configmap.yaml

Let's install this configuration map into kubernetes.
```
kubectl apply -f kube/hello-config.yaml
kubectl get configmap -l app=hello

## Secrets for deployments
A kubernetes secret is like your local.secret.env file.
It is *not* encrypted.
All kubernetes does is provide extra access restrictions
for kubernetes secrets.

See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
for details.


kube/hello-secrt.yaml (purposely misspelled to avoid .gitignore):

.code kube/hello-secrt.yaml

Let's install this secret into kubernetes:
```
kubectl apply -f kube/hello-secrt.yaml
kubectl get secrets -l app=hello
```

## Deployment with configmap and secrets

kube/hello-deployment-env.yaml:

.code kube/hello-deployment-env.yaml /^ {4}spec/,/^ {6}termination/

Notice the envFrom section. This points to hello-config
and hello-secret.

## Test configured/customised deployment

1. Make sure the old basic deployment is deleted.
   ```
   kubectl delete deploy -l app=hello
   kubectl get deploy -l app=hello
   ```

1. Deploy our new deployment with env.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f kube/hello-deployment-env.yaml
   kubectl get deploy -l app=hello
   ```

1. Get node port and test service.
   ```
   kubectl get svc -l app=hello
   curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
   ```

## Take a break: Check that you understand how kubernetes configmaps and secrets work with deployments.

## Kubernetes volumes and volume mounts
A kubernetes volume is a piece of storage.
A volume mount is the location inside of a pod where that storage is mounted.

See [https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/)
for details.

Volume and volumeMounts are declared within a pod template of a deployment.

## kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml

.code kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml /^ {4}spec/,/^ {10}path/

`hostPath` volumes only work for single-node clusters like my development cluster.

In production we would use awsElasticBlockStore or gcePersistentDisk volumes.

## Test deployment with volume mounted

1. Make sure the old deployment is deleted.
   ```
   kubectl delete deploy -l app=hello
   kubectl get deploy -l app=hello
   ```

1. Deploy our new deployment with volume mounts.
   ```
   kubectl apply -f kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml
   kubectl get deploy -l app=hello
   ```

1. Get node port and test service.
   ```
   kubectl get svc -l app=hello
   curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
   ```

 1. Change the contents of the /home/siuyin/testdata/myfile.txt and re-test.

## Development process summarised
1. Write the hello world service code.
1. Create, tag and push a Docker image into an image registry.
1. Create a kubernetes service to act like a load-balancer between
 the outside world and kubernetes pods.
1. Create and apply kubernetes configMap(s) and/or secret(s).
1. Create and apply a kubernetes deployment which
 references:
   1. configMap(s)
   1. secret(s)
   1. volume(s) and volumeMount(s)

## Take a break: Congratulate yourself, you have covered kubernetes 101!

## Reality check: Production requirements

1. The docker images must be tagged with something meaningful
 and not siuyin/junk. Eg. siuyin/myapp:1.0.3
 or siuyin/myapp:6daef3ab (git commit tag).

1. Our deployment names should be something like
 hello-dev, hello-staging, hello-prod instead of just hello
 to reflect the different environments.

1. We must have a systematic, sustainable
 way of customising our configMaps,
 secrets, volumes and volumeMounts to accommodate
 staging, prod etc. environments.

Skaffold is a tool I use to address concern 1.

Kustomize is my preferred tool to address concerns 2 and 3.

## Image tagging
Before we talk about skaffold and kustomize, let's
manually make a small change to our hello world service
and tag it as v0.1.1 .

cmd/hello/main.go:

.code cmd/hello/main.go /http.HandleFunc/,/^\t}\)/

```
docker build -t siuyin/junk:v0.1.1 .
docker push siuyin/junk:v0.1.1
```

## Update kubernetes deployment

kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml:
update siuyin/junk to siuyin/junk:v0.1.1

.code kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml /^ {6}containers/,/^ {8}image/

Update and check the deployment:
```
kubectl apply -f kube/hello-deployment-vol.yaml
kubectl get svc -l app=hello
curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
```

Now let us talk about customising for different environments.

## Kustomize
kustomize v2.0.3 is built into kubectl version 1.14 and above.
see [https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).

```
kubectl help kustomize

```

kustomize is also available as a standalone binary
available for Linux, Mac and Windows.

Use the standalone binary if you want the latest features (currently at v3.9.1 as at 2021-01-01).

```
kustomize version
```

## Customisation base folder
We start by creating a "base" folder to hold the starting
point of customisations.

```
cd kube
mkdir base
cp hello-service.yaml hello-configmap.yaml hello-secrt.yaml hello-deployment base
```


Now we create
kube/base/kustomization.yaml:

.code kube/base/kustomization.yaml

## Apply our kustomization and test
Apply our kustomization with kubectl apply -k (note -k and not -f):
```
kubectl apply -k kube/base
kubectl get pod,svc -l app=hello
curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
```

## Customize for staging environment
Requirements
1. image: siuyin/junk  (note the absence of the version tag)
1. names should be "hello-staging" and not just "hello"


We make a folder to hold our kustomization.yaml
```
mkdir -p kube/overlays/staging
```

## kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml

kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml:

.code kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml /apiVersion/,/\/base/

1. We start customising by adding a suffix to all names.

1. Then we change all label key/value pairs to app: hello-staging

1. Finally we reference everything to the base folder.

## Continue customisation by merging a new configmap

kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml (continued):

.code kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml /configMapGenerator/,/^$/

1. Here we have changed the MESSAGE of hello-config.
1. However because of the previous nameSuffix, the kustomized name of the
 configmap is hello-config-staging.

## Similarly customise by merging a new secret

kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml (continued):

.code kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml /configMapGenerator/,/^$/

## Patch the deployment image
kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml (continued):

.code kube/overlays/staging/kustomization.yaml /patches/,/^$/

Finally we patch the image with kube/overlays/staging/staging-patches.yaml:

.code kube/overlays/staging/staging-patches.yaml


## Apply and test our staging kustomization

```
kubectl apply -k kube/overlays/staging
kubectl get svc,pod -l app=hello-staging
curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
```

Tear down our resources with:
```
kubectl delete -k kube/base
kubectl delete -k kube/overlays/staging
```

## Take a break: Check that you understand how to Kustomize for different environments.

## Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment with Skaffold
Skaffold [https://skaffold.dev/](https://skaffold.dev/) is not only a CI/CD tool,
it is also a continuous development tool.

We start by creating a skaffold.yaml file

.code skaffold.yaml /apiVersion/,/kube\/base/

Note we deploy with kustomize. This requires the standalone
kustomize binary to be available in your PATH.

## Deploy, Update, Re-deploy with skaffold run
```
skaffold run
kubectl get svc,pod -l app=hello
curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
```

Then edit cmd/hello/main.go and skaffold run again.

## Redeploying infrastructure
Issue the command: "skaffold run" to unconditionally
redeploy the infrastructure.

The previous infrastructure will be destroyed and
new infrastructure will be recreated and deployed.

If you want skaffold to recreate only infrastructure that has
changed, use this command variant:
```
SKAFFOLD_LABEL=skaffold.dev/run-id={unique id} skaffold run

```

## Idempotent skaffold: iskaffold.sh

I have a script (iskaffold.sh) for idempotent skaffold:

  ```
  #!/bin/sh
  # idempotent skaffold
  
  # This environment variable is needed to make skaffold idempotent again.
  # Otherwise resources are recreated on each run as the run-id changes.
  
  SKAFFOLD_LABEL=skaffold.dev/run-id=siuyin skaffold "$@"
  ```

And I use it thus to idempotently deploy my infrastructure:
```
iskaffold.sh run
```

## Deploy to staging:
```
iskaffold.sh run -p staging
kubectl get svc,pod -l app=hello-staging
curl 192.168.1.68:{node port}/
```

## Tear down resources:
```
iskaffold.sh delete
iskaffold.sh delete -p staging
```
